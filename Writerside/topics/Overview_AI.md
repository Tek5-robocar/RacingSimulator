# Overview

This is the **AI** part of the *RacingSimulator* project.

The goal of this component is to provide an interface between a Python script (your AI or manual driver) and the Unity simulation.

## What Is This?

To interact with the Unity simulation, we use the `mlagents` and `mlagents_envs` libraries from Unityâ€™s ML-Agents Toolkit.  
These libraries offer a fast, deterministic, and easy-to-use API for communicating with agents in the simulation.

The user must create a Python script that launches the Unity simulation and connects to it via ML-Agents.  
At every frame, the script is prompted to send a decision â€” either human-controlled or AI-generated.

There are two main interaction modes:

1. **Manual Driving** â€“ You control the car using the keyboard (arrow keys), and the script relays these actions to the simulation. This mode is typically used to collect datasets.
2. **AI-Controlled Driving** â€“ Your Python-based AI model decides what actions to take, and the script sends them to the simulation in real-time.
