# Overview

This page provides a high-level overview of the **RacingSimulator** project, which is split into two main components:

[Simulation](./Writerside/topics/Overview_Simulation.md)  
: The Unity-based environment used to simulate racing scenarios for training.

[AI](./Writerside/topics/Overview_AI.md)  
: The Python-based interface and logic that allows your AI agent to connect to and control the simulation.

## What is the RacingSimulator?

The **RacingSimulator** is an AI training environment where your task is to develop and connect an autonomous agent that can control a car in a 3D racing simulation.

The objective is to train your agent to complete laps as efficiently and quickly as possible using reinforcement learning or other AI techniques.  
The simulator offers multiple tracks with increasing levels of difficulty to challenge and evaluate your models.
